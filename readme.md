Blackout Your WordPress Site on January 18th, 2012
=============

[Reddit](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html) and many other sites are planning a blackout to protest SOPA/PIPA on January 18th, 2012.

This plugin lets you easily join them.  For 24 hours, based on the timezone in your WP settings, your blog will be replaced with a simple splash screen displayed below to help raise awareness about SOPA.
